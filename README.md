Includes a node to rotate the camera via the stepper motor (using the encoder feedback).

# rover_power_monitor
ROSâ€¯2 Python node that uses SocketCAN (via the python-can library) to read telemetry from the REV Power Distribution Hub (PDH) on your CAN bus and publish a standard sensor_msgs/BatteryState message. In the design the PDH and the four SparkMax controllers are daisy chained on the same CAN bus.
